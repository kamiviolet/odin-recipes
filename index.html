                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul class="ingredients">
                    <li>10 pork cutlets</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>2 cups breadcrumbs</li>
                    <li>vegetable oil</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Tenderize the pork: Using the flat end of a meat tenderizer, pound the pork working from the center out until the cutlets are ¼" thick. Season each pork cutlet with salt and pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bread the pork: Prepare 3 shallow dishes. One will have the flour, one will have the eggs (beaten), and the last one will have the breadcrumbs. Season each dish with salt and pepper. Dredge each cutlet through flour on both sides, next through the beaten egg and finally through the breadcrumbs. Place them on a large plate and repeat with remaining cutlets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fry the pork: Fill a large skillet with about ½" of oil over medium-high heat and heat it until it's 350°F. Fry the cutlets for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until they're a nice deep golden brown. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate and repeat with remaining schnitzel. You might have to change the oil halfway through if it gets too dirty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve: Serve with lemon wedges and mustard over mashed potatoes.
                    </li>

                            <li>2 ½ cups unpacked powdered sugar, sifted</li>

                    <li>Decoration to your preference
                        <ul>
                            <li>unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                            <li>whipped cream</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat oven to 350°F / 175°C. Line the bottom and the sides of three 8" (20cm) baking pans with parchment paper. Set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make the genoise cake: In a large mixing bowl, using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk eggs on medium speed just until combined. Add sugar and whisk on medium-high speed for about 10-12 minutes until white pale, foamy and tripled in size. (It takes 3-5 minutes longer with a handheld mixer compared to a stand mixer). To know if you have the right consistency, let a bit of batter drip off the whisk attachment on top of the mixed batter. The dripped batter should be visible for 10 seconds before it sinks into the batter. If it sinks earlier, you need to whisk longer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With a wooden spoon, fold in flour, cornstarch baking powder carefully. Don't overwork the batter and don't work too fast otherwise, it will lose too much air. Divide in prepared baking pans and bake for 20-22 minutes until a toothpick centered in the middle comes out clean. Let cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Then remove from pans and remove the paper immediately. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make the mascarpone frosting: Whisk mascarpone on medium speed until creamy for about 2 minutes. Add powdered sugar and whisk until creamy and combined another 1-2 minutes. Add coffee and whisk until well combined and creamy for about 2-3 minutes. Stir in heavy cream and whisk until fully combined and creamy for another 2-3 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assemble the cake: Place the first cake layer on a cake board or cake stand. Brush with a third of the ½ cup coffee.* Then spread ⅓ of the mascarpone cream with an offset spatula on top. Repeat one more time. Place last cake layer on top and lightly frost the outside and the sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Level the top and sides with the offset spatula. Chill at least 4 hours in the fridge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pipe whipped cream on top if desired. Then dust with cocoa just before serving. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge up to 3 days.
                    </li>
